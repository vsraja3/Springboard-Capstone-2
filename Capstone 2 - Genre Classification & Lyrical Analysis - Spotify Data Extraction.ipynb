The primary Spotify API is accessed through it's web based interface, but there is also a Python wrapper developed aptly named 'SpotiPy' that enables the ability to query song data directly through a Python IDE such as Jupyter notebook.\n",

    "After some additional exploration into how the data is stored and accessed on Spotify's end, it appears that there isn't a way to query genre labels on the back end for individuals songs or even artist level genre. However surprisingly enough, on the front end Spotify application and web interface, you can search for music by genre from the search bar using a specific syntax (ex. type \"genre:”Rock” into Spotify's front end search). You can also query song data by means of any public playlist, whether user created or created by Spotify itself. \n",
    "\n",
    "As such, I went ahead and built playlists for 5 different genres: Rock, Pop, Hip-Hop, Country, and EDM. There are of course several more genres and subgenres than the ones chosen, but these five were chosen on the basis that they are distinct enough musically and lyrically to the point where we can extract and analyze the features that define them using our planned analysis. They also represent umbrellas where other genres could potentially fit under (ie. Alternative as a subgenre of rock, Christian as a subgenre of Rock or Country, Indie as a subgenre of Pop or Rock, something that can perhaps be identified using an unsupervised approached and lyrical topic analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "These playlists were then generated using the aforementioned front end search. To try to limit artists labeled with mixed genres on Spotify (ie. Pop/Rock, Country/Rock, Pop/Dance, Country/Hip-Hop, which has become increasingly common in today's music where there seems to be an increased effort to blend genres to maximize appeal and create a more unique sound, I narrowed the front end genre search syntax to find artists only in the specified genre and not any of the other 4. An example of this is \"genre:”Rock” OR genre:”Alternative” NOT genre:”Pop” NOT genre:”Hip-Hop” NOT genre:”Rap” NOT genre:”Country”. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using these queries, I was able to generate playlists on Spotify containing 2000 songs for each genre that Spotify had labeled the artist or album under. This was expected to be a large enough dataset given that there is an equal distribution of songs across genres with a total size of 10,000. With the playlists prepared on the front end on my Spotify account where the playlist setting was set to public, we can access the playlist data using the unique playlist IDs. Below I've found custom functions that extract the data from the API call and take the corresponding output, which is in the form of a complex JSON file, and extract the relevant musical attributes and identifying information.

From there we can translate the values in the field to the format of letter and major or minor (ex. key=0, mode=1 -> C major). From my knowledge of music theory, these keys are representative of the tonic and scales a song is built around. "
